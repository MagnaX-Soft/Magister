Magister
========

Magister is a programmer oriented framework for building complex made-to-order websites. It is a barebones framework, meaning that it provides the bare minimum. It is a scaffolding used to build great things.

Magister provides base classes for error handling (exceptions), controllers, models, model objects (row objects), as well as some helpers for forms, urls, html.

It does not provide i18n at the moment, but it's a planned addition.
